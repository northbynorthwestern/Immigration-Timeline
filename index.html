				<p>In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W. Bush signed legislation to create the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS), resulting in a complete reorganization of governmental
departments. Immigration and Naturalization Services moved from the Department of Justice to the newly formed DHS and created U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2003.</p>

separate families at the border in El Paso, Texas without designing a clear system to track the children or reunite them with their parents. Any migrants crossing the U.S border illegally, including asylum-seekers, were detained and criminally charged.</p>
